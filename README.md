# Django REST Framework Contacts API Template 

## Description 

This is a single model full CRUD API for contacts using Python and Django. 

> This is an **api only**. I would suggest consuming this API using React as a _separate server_ by using [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

### Contacts Properties: 

|Property  | Type  | Default  |
|---|---|---|
| id | integer | assigned by db |
| name | string | n/a |
| age | int | n/a |

### Contacts Routes: 

|Endpoint  | Action  |
|---|---|
| `/api/contacts`  | GET (Index) |
| `/api/contacts/:id`  | GET (Show)  |
| `/api/contacts`  | POST  |
| `/api/contacts/:id`  | DELETE  |
| `/api/contacts/:id`  | PUT  |

## System Requirements 

- Python 3 
- pipenv 

### Installation

If you don't have either of the above, please install them. 

<details><summary>Python3 Installation</summary><p>
    
#### Python Installation

1. Check what python version you have on your computer by running: `python -V`
1. If you're not on a version of Python that is 3 or greater, install python 3 with homebrew:
    - `brew install python3` 
    - Note: in order to use this installed python3, you will have to use `python3` whenever running a python command 
    
</p></details>

<details><summary>pipenv Installation</summary><p>
    
#### pipenv Installation

To build your app, we're going to be building a virtual environment. In order to manage our dependencies and our virtual environment, we're going to use [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

1. Check if you have pipenv by running: `pipenv --version` 
1. If you do not have it, install it with homebrew:
    - `brew install pipenv` 
    
</p></details>

## Get Set Up Locally 

### On your Browser 

1. Fork this repository to your account 

### In your Terminal 

1. Clone **your fork** of the repo onto your computer anywhere that is not a git repo
1. `cd` into the repo 
1. Touch a `.env` into the root of your project and add a SECRET_KEY value. See the .env.sample file for an example
1. Install all the required packages by running: `pipenv install` 
1. Activate the virtual environment by running: `pipenv shell`
    - NOTE: To exit the shell gracefully whenever you're done working, use `exit`
1. Create the `django_contacts` psql database and user by running the following while in the pipenv shell: `psql -U postgres -f settings.sql` 
    - You can find the database name and username/password inside the settings.sql file
1. Apply the migrations by running the following while in the pipenv shell: `python3 manage.py migrate`
1. Make a superuser for your app, this will allow you to work directly with your database on the browser without having to use Postman 
    - In the pipenv shell, run `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` and follow the instructions
1. Start the Django server by running the following inside the pipenv shell: `python3 manage.py runserver` 

### On your Browser 

1. Go to `localhost:8000/api/contacts`. You should see the Django REST Framework interface like so:

1. Click the `Log In` on the top right corner and use the username/password you created when making the superuser 
1. You should now be able to add / delete / edit / read contacts directly from your browser

## Making Changes 

### Updating / Creating Models 

1. If you make any changes to the `contacts_api/models.py` file, you will need to make and run a migration to apply the changes. You can do so by using the following commands while _inside the pipenv shell_
    1. Make the migration: `python3 manage.py makemigrations` 
    1. Apply the migration: `python3 manage.py migrate`

## Set Up for Heroku Deployment 

### In Terminal
1. Create a heroku app from the root of your project folder, run: `heroku create` 
    - The above command will randomly generate a name for you, if you want to name your app something specific run: `heroku create urlNameYouWantHere`

### In your Code Editor 

1. Copy the heroku url that was created (without the `https://`), go to your `django_rest_api/settings.py` and add it into the `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
    - e.g. 
    ![](https://imgur.com/AVlB8kK.png)
    
### On the Browser 

1. Go to your heroku dashboard for the heroku project you just created
1. Click on Configure Add-Ons
1. Search for Heroku Postgres and add it 
1. Go to the Settings, Reveal Config Vars, add a config var for SECRET_KEY and anything else you have in your .env file 

### In Terminal

1. `pipenv lock` to ensure your pipfile.lock is up to date
1. `git add -A`
1. `git commit -m "heroku deployment"`
1. `git push heroku master` 
1. Once it builds successfully, run `heroku run bash` 
1. While in heroku bash,  apply the migrations to the heroku project by running: `python manage.py migrate` 
1. Still in heroku bash, create a superuser for the heroku project by running `python manage.py createsuperuser` and follow the prompts
    - To exit heroku bash, run `exit`

### In Browser 

1. After the migrations finish, you should now be able to open the heroku app in your browser to see the same Django REST interface!
    - Don't forget to go to `/api/contacts`
1. Remember that your heroku database is separate from your local database, so there should not be any data on the first load. 
    - You can add data by logging in with the heroku superuser you created
1. You can now use this deployed version as your backend API
